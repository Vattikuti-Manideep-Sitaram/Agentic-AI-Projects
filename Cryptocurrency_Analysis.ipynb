This marks the first major policy initiative from President Trump's administration regarding cryptocurrency. Bitcoin surged to a record high of $109,071 but faced initial declines due to its absence in Trump's inauguration speech and Day One executive orders. Despite this, Bitcoin rose 3.8% and Ethereum 1.4% as the market reacted positively to the SEC's plans.

            "### 1. **Model Pruning and Quantization**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Model Pruning**: Remove redundant or unnecessary weights and connections in the model to reduce computational requirements. This can be done using techniques like iterative magnitude pruning or movement pruning.\n",
            "*   **Quantization**: Represent model weights and activations using lower-precision data types (e.g., int8 instead of float32) to reduce memory usage and increase computation speed.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. **Knowledge Distillation**\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",

            "\n",
            "### 4. **Parallelization and Distributed Computing**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Data Parallelism**: Split the input data across multiple GPUs or machines to process in parallel, reducing overall inference time.\n",
            "*   **Model Parallelism**: Split the model itself across multiple GPUs or machines, processing different parts of the model in parallel.\n",
